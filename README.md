# MLTC-patient trajectory
In this study, 
* we explored techniques to optimise the interpretability of clusters of LTCs by applying existing topic modelling techniques to patients with MLTC from the UK Biobank, to discover meaningful connections between long-term conditions.
* Aim to quantify the association of each individual with each of the topics generated by LDA.

* Using association strength based on the patients medical history, we observe the patients trajectory between the clusters, also potentially discovering risk indicators that we can in turn use to optimise the prediction of a patientâ€™s trajectory.


### Folder Structure

MLTC

    Data - Contains the datasets used and produced in the research.

    Images - Contains the images used in the research.

    notebooks - Contains the code used in the research.

    requirements.txt - Python package dependencies for this research.


### To run the the Analysis

* First install all the dependencies of python using pip. (Given in requirements.txt)
* Structure the folders as per the folder structure mentioned above.
* Run the note books.
    Note
    * BLOCK 3 OF 'LDA_Association_Str.ipynb' does not run in one go. Patient data needs to be divided into multiple parts for easy processing. - Instruction written in the code block.

    * Block 3 produces a dataset with all the details of the patient. It is already stored with the name - 'Results.csv'
